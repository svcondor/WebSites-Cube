<h2>Cube - Help</h2>
<h3>How to use the app </h3>
  Drag along a side to rotate a cube face.
<br />Drag along center to rotate the whole cube in all 3 directions.
<br />
<br />Reset – to reset the cube
<br />Scramble – to scramble the cube
<br/> Elipsis - Bring up menu for Help, Crib, Sbout
<br />Left arrow – undo the last move
<br />Right Arrow - do the next step for me
<br/>

<h3>How to solve the cube </h3>
<h4>Notation Used in solving instructions</h4>
  F Front face - left on the display
<br/>B Back face - opposite the front
<br/>R Right face - right on the display
<br/>L Left face - opposite the right
<br/>U Upper face - top on the display
<br/>D Down face - opposite the upper
<br/>
<br/>F rotate the front face clockwise
<br/>F' rotate the front face anti-clockwise
<br/>U U' rotate the upper top face
<br/>D D' rotate the lower down face
<br/>R R' rotate the right face
<br/>L L' rotate the left face
<br/>B B' rotate the back face
<br/>
<br/>There are 8 corner pieces each with 3 color tiles
<br/>There are 12 side pieces each with 2 color tiles
<br/>The color of a face is the color of the center tile
<br/>
<br/>

<h4> Step 1 - White Cross</h4>
  Rotate the whole cube so that the white center piece is on the UP face
<br />Make a white cross on the UP face
<br />The side colors of the white cross pieces must correpond to the center pieces below them.
<br />
<br/>

<h4>Step 2 - white Corner pieces </h4>
  Move the 4 white corner pieces to their correct location and orientation
<br/>
<br/>

<h4>Step 3 - Edge pieces of the middle layer</h4>
    Rotate the whole cube so that the yellow center piece is on the UP face
<br/>Rotate the cube and/or the UP face so that an edge piece has the same color
   as the center piece on the FRONT face below it.
   The top colour of the piece must not be yellow.
<br/>
<br/>U' L' U L U F U' F' to rotate that piece anticlockwise to the left
<br/>U R U' R' U' F' U F to rotate that piece clockwise to the right
<br/>
<br/>If there are no suitable pieces on the UPPER layer then do one of the above moves
  to get a piece from the middle layer to the top.
<br/>
<br/>

<h4>Step 4 - Make a Yellow cross on the top layer</h4>
  Don't worry about the side colors of the yellow cross yet.
<br /> Rotate the UP face to get 3 yellow in middle above FRONT face then
<br /> F R U R' U' F'
<br /> otherwise rotate the UP face to get yellow 'L' in back left, then Do.
<br /> F U R U' R' F'
<br /> otherwise
<br /> F U R U' R' F'
<br /> Repeat until you get a yellow cross
<br/>
<br/>

<h4>Step 5 - Correct the side colors of the Yellow cross</h4>
  To swap the front yellow tile with the left yellow tile, do the following.
<br />R U R' U R U U R' U
<br />repeat if necessary
<br/>


<h4> Step 6 - Get the yellow corners to their correct positions</h4>
  Don't worry about their orientation yet i.e. if the yellow tile is on top. If the 4 corner tiles are in their correct positions go to step 7.
<br />
<br />  If one of the tiles is in the correct position whether or not the yellow tile is on
  top then rotate the whole cube until that piece is at the top left of the front face.
  Do the following move:
  U R U' L' U R' U' L
<br /> Repeat the above up to 3 times to get all the yellow corners in their correct locations.
<br />
<br/>


<h4> Step 7 - Orientate the yellow corners correctly</h4>
  Throughout this step, keep the yellow center tile on the UP face and the blue center tile facing
  you as the FRONT face.   During this step some of the lower pieces will get scrambled,
  follow the procedure and they will be back in place when all 4 yellow corners are correct.
  Keep the blue center tile facing you as the front face.
<br />
<br />Rotate the UP face so that a piece without a yellow top tile is
  at the top right corner of the front face.
<br /> Do the following either 2 or 6 times until this top right tile is orientated
  correctly. Some of the lower tiles might be scrambled until all four corners are correct scambled.
<br />R' D' R D
<br/>
<br />Without moving the blue FRONT center rotate the UP face until another incorrectly orientated
  piece is in the top right position.
<br /> Do the same moves again and repeat for all the incorrect yellow corners.
<br /> rotate the UP face to allign with the lower 2 faces and you're DONE!
